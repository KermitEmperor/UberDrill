# ÃœberDrill

This mod adds a mining drill that can be placed anywhere for infinite resources, however it needs a very strong acid to mine this deep and it will require coolant if Space Exploration is present. The Drill texture is WIP.

Other mods me and iHouqLF made:
- [Spidertron Engineer MK2 (BIG Edition)](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SpidertronEngineer2) A forked version of [SpidertronEngineer](https://github.com/tburrows13/SpidertronEngineer):
  - Build your factory as a Spidertron from the start! Instead of unlocking better weapons and armor, unlock upgrades to yourself. This fork adds bigger spidertrons that can be unlocked through upgrades. A major change is the custom science pack and the grand mother board. The grand motherboard is purple, and its used to make the custom science pack, which is very expensive. (Have fun automating spidertron prioduction)
